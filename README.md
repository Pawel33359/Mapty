# Mapty
This project was made with help of online course on Udemy called "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!" made by Jonas Schmedtmann.
This is a website that uses Leaflet library to allow users to put marks on the map with the information about running or cycling you were doing in that place.
To this project I added on my own: delete options, edit option, sorting and error messages.
